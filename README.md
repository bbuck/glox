# Go Lox

This is a Go implementation of the Lox Programming Langauge which is part of the
[Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) book.

This is a non-idiomatic Go implementation of the language as it's mostly a
direct port of the Java code specified in the book (and eventually the C code).

This programming language serves no purpose, this repo exists purely for
educational purposes (a place for my efforts working through the book and a
place for your reference if you so choose).

Eventaully this will contain a tree walking, then byte code compiling version
and if I feel so inclined I may rewrite it to be more idiomatic when I finish
the book but probably not.

## Purpose

The reason I'm working on this book and this langauge, and in Go, is to build my
own programming language that is a Frakenstein's monster of languages I find
enjoyable or simple to work with. I'll have more information about this future
language as I continue fine tuning it's syntax.
